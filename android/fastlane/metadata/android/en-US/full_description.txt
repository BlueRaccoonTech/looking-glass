This app is primarily designed for admins and moderators of servers that communicate in the Fediverse. This will allow you to view the public timelines of any server that utilizes Mastodon's API, so you may be able to make a more informed decision about which instances you should have your server federate with. This app is currently designed only to view data from instances - you can't currently log into an instance with this app.
